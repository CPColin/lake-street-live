# Lake Street Live

My favorite live versions of every [Lake Street Dive](https://www.lakestreetdive.com) song I can find.

Like all great bands, LSD is always tinkering.
Over the years, many people have uploaded videos from LSD shows.
Some of these videos show early versions of songs, from before the band landed on the style they liked best.
Some of these videos demonstrate how the band tweaks songs so they work better for the live crowd (and also because McDuck can't play three trumpets at once).
All of these videos show why this band is special.

I can't entirely quantify what's going to make a video show up here, but I can make a few guesses:
* Crowd energy is key, but studio performances for things like radio shows will do in a pinch.
* It's fun when the band tries new things.
* Having good audio and video quality is important, but not vital.

Let's rock.

## Side Pony

I won't mince words: This album inspired this project.
My introduction to LSD was when they were touring _Side Pony_ and played a show in San Luis Obispo.
I excitedly pre-ordered the album because "So Long" made me want to burst into tears and I wanted to play it on repeat forever.

When my copy arrived, I deflated; the song didn't stir me.
Similarly, "How Good It Feels" was missing its descending return to coziness that I remembered from the live version; instead, it soars to a finish.
"Hell Yeah" lost half of its live energy and driving rhythm.

It wasn't until I'd bought copies of _Bad Self Portraits_ and _Free Yourself Up_ that I realized _Side Pony_ was the outlier here.
I've since speculated that the band chose to self-produce _Free Yourself Up_ because they felt _Side Pony_ had been polished just a little too much.

I don't want to get too down on the album in service of explaining myself.
The songs are awesome.
So let's find the best versions of them and remember why we fell in love with Lake Street Dive.
